Getting started
---------------

*Propensity\_simulations.r*: will recreate the simulated scenarios from the MS.

*Propensity\_TreeCover\_Analyis.r*: will recreate the treecover analysis from the case study.

Prerequisites
-------------

The simulation script require packages *optmatch*, *tidyverse*, *survey*, *forcats* and *RColorBrewer* while the tree cover analysis requires in addition, *cobalt* , *readr* and *treatsens*.
