Getting started
---------------

*Propensity\_simulations.r*: will recreate the simulated scenarios from the MS.

*Propensity\_TreeCover\_Analyis.r*: will recreate the treecover analysis from the case study.

Prerequisites
-------------

The simulation script require packages *optmatch*, *tidyverse*, *survey*, *forcats*, while the tree cover analysis requires in addition, *cobalt*,and *readr*.
