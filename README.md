Ramsey, D.S.L., Forsyth, D.M., Wright, E., McKay, M., and Westbrooke, I. (2018). "Using propensity scores for causal inference in ecology: options, considerations and a case study" _Methods in Ecology and Evolution_  

### Getting Started

_Propensity_simulations.r_ will recreate the simulated scenarios from the MS.

_Propensity_TreCover_Analyis.r_ will recreate the treecover analysis from the case study.


### Prerequisites

The simulation script require packages _optmatch_, _tidyverse_, _survey_, _forcats_, while the tree cover analysis requires in addition, _cobalt_,and  _readr_.
