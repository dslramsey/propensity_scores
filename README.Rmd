## Getting started


**File descriptions**:

_Propensity_simulations.R_  –  R code used to conduct Monte Carlo simulations of propensity score methods.   Uses functions defined in _propensity_simulation_functions.R_ 

_Propensity_simulation_functions.R_ – R functions used to perform propensity score simulations and helper functions to calculate IPTW weights calc.pswts() and weights from full matching get.match.weights() that target either the ATE or ATT.

_Propensity_TreeCover_Analysis.R_ – R code used to estimate effects of possum control on canopy tree condition using propensity scores. Uses data provided in _Tree_Cover_data.csv_.


## Prerequisites

The simulation script require packages _optmatch_, _tidyverse_, _survey_, _forcats_ and _RColorBrewer_ while the tree cover analysis requires in addition, _cobalt_ , _readr_ and _treatsens_.
