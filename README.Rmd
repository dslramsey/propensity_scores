## Getting started


_Propensity_simulations.r_: will recreate the simulated scenarios from the MS.
 

_Propensity_TreeCover_Analyis.r_:  will recreate the treecover analysis from the case study.


## Prerequisites

The simulation script require packages _optmatch_, _tidyverse_, _survey_, _forcats_ and _RColorBrewer_ while the tree cover analysis requires in addition, _cobalt_ , _readr_ and _treatsens_.
